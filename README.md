# DBMS-Mumbai_Dabbawala
The Mumbai Dabbawala system is renowned for its efficient and accurate lunchbox delivery model across Mumbai. Our project captures this real-world logistics system in the form of a relational database that can manage:

-Dabbawalas (delivery personnel)
-Customers (senders/receivers)
-Dabbas (lunchboxes)
-Orders and payments
-Holidays, punishments, and donations,etc

Key Features
-Entity-Relationship (ER) Design: Modeled real-world entities and relationships to create an intuitive ER diagram.
-Relational Schema Design: Converted ER model into well-defined relational tables.
-Normalization to BCNF: Ensured all tables are in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate redundancy and anomalies.
-Functional Dependencies (FDs): Identified and minimized FDs for each relation.
-SQL Implementation: Created DDL scripts for table creation, insert statements for sample data, and complex SQL queries for reporting and analysis.
